I'm a sixth year PhD student in mathematics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and am advised by [Jordan Ellenberg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZTKuMBJP7Y). I'm interested in how we can apply [Reinforcement Learning (RL)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zR11FLZ-O9M) - a field of [machine learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q87K1WaoFI) where we train a computer agent to learn how to take actions in an environment - to problems in pure mathematics and science to help mathematicians and scientists conjecture, discover, and prove new truths in their fields. 

Currently, my research focuses on creating generative RL to generate useful, interpretable data in additive combinatorics for mathematicians in this area to use to inform conjectures and proofs. I'm also interning at [IBM Research](https://www.ibm.com/us-en), where I'm working on building AI and optimization tools for discovering new scientific laws from data and known background theory encoded in terms of polynomial and differential axioms. I'm excited by what mathematics and science will look like in 100 years and the ai-powered tools academics in the future will have access to, and I'm driven to do my small part in this rich field of possibilites. I'm also affiliated with the [Wisconsin Institute for Discovery](https://wid.wisc.edu/) and the [Institute for Foundations of Data-Science](https://ifds.info/).

I was born in Kolkata, India - a city rich in history and culture with bustling streets and great food - and lived there until I moved to the calmer lands of Illinois, where I got my BSc in Mathematics at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/). I also spent a semester at the [Independent University of Moscow](https://ium.mccme.ru/english/) as a part of the [Math in Moscow](https://mathinmoscow.org/) study abroad program.
