What do we really mean when we say "the economy does better when my favorite political party is in power" or what do we really mean when we say ["unvaccinated adults are 3-5 times more likely to get omicron infection"](https://www.aha.org/news/headline/2022-01-21-cdc-unvaccinated-adults-3-5-times-more-likely-get-omicron-infection#:~:text=According%20to%20data%20from%2025,who%20had%20received%20a%20booster). A very natural property of interest in any dataset is the pattern of [correlation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation) - when two events are statistically related. These patterns are important, but when we believe these things, we really want to say that "the economy is better *because* of my favorite party, and not just they happen to occur together. Establishing the causal relationships between phenomenon is the study of [causal inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_inference#:~:text=Causal%20inference%20is%20the%20process,component%20of%20a%20larger%20system.). You might have heard the phrase 'correlation is not the same as causation'. This is true. While it both the number of tech companies and the number of teddy bears sold has gone up over the last few decades, one does not necessarily cause the other (perhaps both are caused by, among lots of other things, an increase in population sizes leading to more children buying teddy bears and a bigger scientific community built over the years). 

I'm interested in causal inference, at the highest level, because it is in some sense the most natural question to ask when studying complex datasets. Questions about causation are often the most interesting and, so, ineherently the most enlightening in any survey. We know when the economy rises and fauls but it's establishing its cause thats the most interesting. Mathematically, this presents much richer questions: how does one quantitatively establish causation between variables? how is causation structurally different from phenomenon to phenomenon? and how do we quantify that difference? These questions have a lot of implication on not only our understanding of economic and natural phenomenon but also about the human mind and our understanding of how we learn things and form such associations and establish legitimate and unfound causal relationships. I'm interested in these sorts of questions and am looking to explore these in greater depth because I'm fascinated by the question of causation, the mathematical bases on which it can be established, and the understanding of human behavior and learning patterns that this brings.
