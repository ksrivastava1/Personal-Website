I worked with [Daniel Pimentel-AlarÄ‡on](https://danielpimentel.github.io/) on a project on approximating incomplete data with varieties. If there's some unknown data that we think has linear structure and we only have access to noisy low dimensional projections (think - an unknown (linear) object in a dark room and I only show you the shadows after we shine a light), how accurately can we reconstruct the original unknown data? We derived an upper bound to this in our paper: <em> a perturbation bound for the optimal subspace estimator from canonical projections</em>. See [github](https://github.com/ksrivastava1/identifying-subspaces) for some code the [publication page](https://karansrivastava.com/publication/isit22/) for a copy of the paper and slides from my presentation at the [IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9834816).
