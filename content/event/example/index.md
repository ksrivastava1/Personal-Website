abstract: "'Given a chessboard with a coin on every square randomly oriented and a key hidden under one of them; player one knows where the key is and flips a single coin; player 2, using only the information of the new coin arrangement must determine where the coin is. Is there a winning strategy?' In this talk, we will explore this classic puzzle in a more generalized context, with n squares and d sided dice on every square, and see when the game is solvable and in doing so, see how the answer relies on group theory and the existence of certain groups!"
