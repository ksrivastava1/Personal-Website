abstract: "The process for solving rubiks cubes can often involve memorizing
  over 25 algorithms. But with a little bit of knowledge of commutators and
  group theory, one can solve a rubiks cube entirely memorizing no more than
  just 1. In this talk, I will go over the connections between commutators,
  basic group theory, and solving one of the most iconic puzzles in the world!
  Bonus - we will also see how it's possible to solve these blindfolded along
  the way. "
