title: Using varieties to study polynomial neural networks
abstract: "In this talk, I will explore the work of Kileel, Trager, and Bruna in
  their 2019 paper [On the Expressive power of Polynomial Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12207). In
  the talk, I will look at 1) what a polynomial neural network is and how we can
  interpret the output such networks as varieties, 2) why the dimension of this
  variety and the expressive power of this network are related, and 3) how the
  study of these varieties might tell us something about the architecture of the
  network. "
