title: "Specialty Exam Presentation: Reinforcement Learning for finding isosceles-free subsets of an integer lattice"
abstract: In this prelim / specialty exam talk, I present my work in generating large isosceles-free subsets of an integer lattice. I first briefly present the motivation of the problem from ordinal embedding theory applied to concept analysis in cognitive science, then I go through the mathematical background for the problem, and finally, present my ongoing work in building a reinforcement learning framework for generating large isosceles-free subsets for improving current best lower bounds for the problem.
