title: Why people say "I can't do math"
abstract: "Mathematicians and math educators often hear the phrase \"I can't do
  math\". Why is that? People often have the essential skills required to do
  mathematics - logic, the capacity to break down ideas, and rational thought.
  But in many education systems today, many of us convince ourselves that math
  is beyond our capabilities. In this talk, I explore why that is. "
