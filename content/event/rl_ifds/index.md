title: A Perturbation Bound on the Subspace Estimator from Canonical Projections
abstract: "This paper derives a perturbation bound on the optimal subspace estimator obtained from a subset of its canonical projections contaminated by noise. This fundamental result has important implications in matrix completion, subspace clustering, and related problems."

I worked with [Daniel Pimentel-AlarÄ‡on](https://danielpimentel.github.io/) on a project on approximating incomplete data with varieties. If there's some unknown data that we think has linear structure and we only have access to noisy low dimensional projections (think - an unknown (linear) object in a dark room and I only show you the shadows after we shine a light), how accurately can we reconstruct the original unknown data? We derived an upper bound to this in our paper: <em> a perturbation bound for the optimal subspace estimator from canonical projections</em>.
