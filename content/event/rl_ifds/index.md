title: Reinforcement Learning for Finding Large Sets in Extremal Combinatorics
abstract: In this talk, we present our work done in building a reinforcement learning framework for generating large sets for three problems in extremal combinatorics; i. generating large isosceles-free subsets of an integer lattice, ii. generating the same for an integer lattice embedded on a torus, and iii. generating coliniear-triple-free subsets of an integer lattice. Generating these by brute force is super-exponential in time complexity, but we can achieve state-of-the-art results through traditional a reinforcement learning framework. We explore our methodology, results, and future directions for this work.
