I'm the graduate coordinator of the UW - Madison Experimental Math Lab, an undergraduate research program initiative by the UW Math Department!

Mathematics research is accessible at all levels of our lives! This is including, but not limited to, undergraduates. At the Madison Experimental Math Lab, we're hoping to create an opportunity for undergraduate students at UW Madison to get some experience doing semester-long math research projects under faculty advisors and graduate mentors. 

Our aim is to connect faculty, graduate students, and undergraduates through these projects. For undergraduate students, this is a chance to build mathematical networks and see how math research works under the hood. For graduate students, this is an opportunity to polish  mentoring skills by facilitating research for students, working on interesting math problems in small teams, and exploring research with lots of different faculty members. For faculy members, we hope this gives you a way to enrich mathematical discussions in your favorite fields of math at our department and help young train driven young math-lovers!
