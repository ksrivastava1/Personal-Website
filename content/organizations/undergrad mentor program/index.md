I'm starting and organizing the new Undergraduate Mentor Program at the UW Math Department. The aim is to pair undergraduate students in math with graduate mentors who will help give career advice and mentorship in order for undergrads to make the most out of their degree. If you're an undergraduate in math at UW-Madison, you should definitely check this out! What you can expect to get out of this:

<b> If you're not sure what your options are </b>: 
You'll learn about the various opportunities you have as an undergraduate student in math and how to narrow these options down and come up with a gameplan for the following academic year. 

<b> If you're thinking about the summer and post-graduation plans </b>: 
We'll help you think about your career goals and narrow down courses and summer plans - REUs, Internships, and so on - so that you can spend your time in the second half of your undergrad building goals and working toward them productively. 

<b>If you know what you're applying for:</b>
Our aim is to help you get an early start with narrowing down potential programs, reaching out to letter of reccommendation writers, work on your CVs and statements, and put in the best applications you can!

Whichever boat you find yourself in - we're here to help you make your time in undergrad as productive and engaging as can be. We're also hosting a professional development workshop where we'll talk about what makes a good CV and statement of purpose, help you work on your drafts for these, and have an interactive presentation and q&a session with [Tullia Dymarz](https://people.math.wisc.edu/~dymarz/) - the Director of Graduate Studies at the Math Department at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. 

If you're interested or have questions, feel free to reach out!
